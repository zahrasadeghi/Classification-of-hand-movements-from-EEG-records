# Classification-of-hand-movements-from-EEG-records
From the invention of the first computer, humans have used them in a variety of areas to simplify and even make them possible. Although at first, computers were only a means to help humans, this simple role was never enough, the idea of intelligent computers, the ability to understand and learn, quickly came up. The design of a system that can be learned like human beings have become the first scientific motivation to a field that we know as machine learning.
machine-learning has been improved remarkably in the past decades due to its attractiveness and importance in various fields. One of the most important areas is medicine. Today, with the help of various methods of machine learning, specialists in the field of medicine can do things that were impossible before. These include controlling the patients' particular organs by analyzing and identifying their brain signals. Choosing a method for this purpose is challenging due to the wide range of machine learning methods.
In this project, we will show that deep learning methods have higher accuracy than classical machine learning methods in categorizing and detecting hand movements from the EEG records.
The dataset that is used in this project is available on Kaggle (Grasp-and-Lift EEG Detection).
*detailed information of implementation is available in the report (in Persian) and in the presentation.
